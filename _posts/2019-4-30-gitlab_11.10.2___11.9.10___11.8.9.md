GitLab kun je vergelijken met het bekendere GitHub, maar bevat een aantal subtiele verschillen. Het is een omgeving voor het beheren van Git-repositories on-premises. Het wordt uitgegeven onder de MIT Expat-licentie en ontwikkeld in Ruby on Rails. Het is beschikbaar in twee versies, namelijk de gratis te gebruiken Community Edition en een betaalde Enterprise Edition, met meer functies die op grote bedrijven zijn gericht. De twee smaken worden op deze pagina uiteengezet. Het ontwikkelteam heeft GitLab 11.10.2, 11.9.10, en 11.8.9 uitgebracht met de volgende aankondiging: GitLab Security Release: 11.10.2, 11.9.10, and 11.8.9 Today we are releasing versions 11.10.2, 11.9.10, and 11.8.9 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).
